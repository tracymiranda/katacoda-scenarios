# In this scenario we will look into how to create an array using Eclipse January.

## What is January?

Eclipse January is a set of libraries for handling numerical data in Java. It is inspired in part by NumPy and aims to provide similar functionality. 

In this scenario we get hands-on with fundamental API calls running them in Java 9's JShell, which gives us an environment for quick feedback & iterations.

If you want to run jshell with January outside of this scenario use these instructions of how to use it in the command line https://kichwacoders.com/2017/05/25/woohoo-java-9-has-a-repl-getting-started-with-jshell-and-eclipse-january/
